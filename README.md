# A basic example for an intermediary server between FrontEnd and API.

To simplify studies with GraphQL, I believe that a good initial step is to see a practical example of how the technology works.

For learning purposes, we have access to abundant content on the subject today! However, what we find least often is an example as simple as this one.

I hope you can visualize and understand the goal and how it works in terms of the basic operation of GraphQL technology through code.
